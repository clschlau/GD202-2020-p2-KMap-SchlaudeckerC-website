For example, we’re looking into a compostable option for coffee cups. We have also teamed up with Starbucks and Port City Java to encourage reusables by offering 10¢ off your order.” -Milannee St. Hill, Professional</i></p>

    <p class="w3-justify w3-large">The Problem</p>   
    <p class="w3-justify">In addition to recycling behaviors on campus, waste from coffee consumption—especially on college campuses—represents a large component of landfills in the US. Through my research, I discovered Catherine Tucker’s book Coffee Culture. In Tucker’s book, she states that universities have led the way for environmental awareness and change. However, while they are known to promote environmental responsibility, actions don’t always match the campus mission.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">In Tucker’s book, she discusses a case study that was conducted at Canada’s Green University, Prince Edward University. In this study, researchers found that disposable coffee cups represented 34 percent of the university’s waste, and the largest proportion by weight of all drink containers; over 5,000 cups were sent to the landfill each week. While this finding does not represent such responsibility, efforts to reduce coffee cup waste have emerged. Since then, they have encouraged the use of reusable mugs around campus.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">While it is apparent that NC State has made similar efforts, the use of single-use coffee cups is still a tremendous problem. After speaking with the Outreach Coordinator at the Waste Reduction and Recycling Center on campus, I learned about their efforts to combat this issue. However, while NC State’s sustainable efforts are evident, it seems that they go unnoticed by the majority. Even though incentives are offered to encourage reusables, students continue to use single-use cups that are harmful to our environment.</p>
