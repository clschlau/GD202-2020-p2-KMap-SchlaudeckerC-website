    <p class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-10"> 
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>“A sustainable campus promotes socially just and vibrant communities, is economically responsible, and conserves finite resources.”</i></p>

    <p class="w3-justify">Waste management is an essential part of sustainable development and education on this matter is vital for future generations. Most universities aim to create sustainable environments for their students in order to encourage healthy “green” habits. As a result, surrounding communities follow in example.However, some higher education institutions fall short in educating and motivating their students properly. If not addressed, this deficit, along with others could be detrimental to the future of environmental sustainability.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Sustainability cannot be successful without the understanding and active participation from college students. It is vital that we understand concerns such as psychological behavior, precedent and budgetary restrictions in order to make strides toward successful, pro-environmental intervention. As a student of NC State University, and in recognizing the importance of environmental protection, I have conducted research which questions the awareness of sustainable practices around our campus. The goal of my project is to properly inform students, while also addressing three main issues at NC State: campus behavior, coffee, and cost.</p>
