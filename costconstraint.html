But if no one is using them, and we’re losing inventory and money, then what is the point of pouring money into those resources?” -Milannee St. Hill, Professional</i></p>

    <p class="w3-justify w3-large">The Problem</p>     
    <p class="w3-justify">The final problem with sustainability efforts on college campuses involves financial responsibility. It is known that universities have placed great emphasis on sustainable efforts and environmental awareness. However, at the same time, these institutions are also forced to confront budgetary restrictions. Costly sustainable endeavors are not favorable among these institutions and their administrators. And most of the time, the budget is given higher prioritization.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">After speaking with Milannee St. Hill,  a professional at NC State’s Waste Reduction and Recycling Center, I found this statement to be true. NC State has to follow a budget, and a lot of times their decisions are based on that initial financial plan. In addition, some projects are held off until a new fiscal year begins, according to Milannee. </p>
    <p class="w3-justify">However, while NC State has a strict budget to follow, they already have a number of initiatives and resources in place. It is up to the students to take advantage of those resources.</p>

 <div class="w3-row w3-padding-16" id="space"></div>  
    
    <p class="w3-justify">As Milannee explained, some resources already exist, but student behavior affects whether or not NC State will continue financing such resources. One example that she described related to compostables. For example, NC State is putting money into providing dining halls with compostable plates, but those plates are still ending up in landfill bins. Thus, their decision to pull funding from that project became an obvious choice.</p>      
    <p class="w3-justify">From this finding, it is clear that this issue relates back to student behavior, and more importantly, education. Our University has the ability to supply reusable and compostable items, but we are not utilizing them correctly.</p>       
    <p class="w3-justify">This instance highlights the overarching problem: NC State has the means to accommodate and promote sustainable practice, but education and awareness surrounding the matter is falling short.</p>
