I think there is a lot of infrastructure already in place, especially at Talley, but the education and awareness surrounding the correct behavior is lacking.” -James Withrow, Grad Student</i></p>

    <p class="w3-justify w3-large">The Problem</p>  
    <p class="w3-justify">A big issue we face with waste management is human behavior. In the case of colleges and universities, sustainable practices cannot be successful without the cooperation and active participation from students. However, despite the importance of such sustainable efforts, there appears to be a gap between environmental concern and actual recycling behavior of students.</p> 
    <p class="w3-justify">After speaking with several students at NC State, it became evident that there is a need for education surrounding correct recycling behavior. While there is some signage around campus, there are inconsistencies among buildings, which creates confusion. A number of students expressed concern for this discrepancy and questioned why such information was not relayed at orientation. Thus, any confusion surrounding correct waste disposal falls on the University’s lack of instruction.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">Though this shortcoming was revealed, students are still accountable for the decisions they make. When discussing behavior with NC State students, many of them expressed their own faults. Some of the behaviors they mentioned included laziness and forgetfulness. Students also suggested that convenience factored into their behavior, as well. If NC State could provide students with the means to manage waste properly, while also educating and promoting healthy actions, would student behavior change?</p>  
    <p class="w3-justify">Through more formal research, I came upon an article that discussed human behavior in the context of recycling. In this article, Moonhee Cho discusses behavioral theories and how our decisions can be influenced. One of these theories is called the theory of planned behavior. It is a social psychological pattern that explains what makes an individual engage in a targeted behavior. For instance, the more positive an individual’s attitude is toward a certain behavior, and the more they receive praise from relevant people about that behavior, the stronger a person’s intentions to exhibit the behavior will be.</p> 
    <p class="w3-justify">Thus, the question further becomes: Is it possible to encourage positive behavior surrounding sustainability?</p>
